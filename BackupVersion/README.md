# Modrinth Backup Version 1.0.9

## Overview

This special backup version of the SkyPlebbin modpack ensures the modpack's longevity by including all mods and dependencies, even those no longer available online. Version 1.0.9 corresponds to Version 1.0.1, currently hosted on Modrinth.

Note: This version is only available on GitHub.

## Why This Backup Exists

I am no longer maintaining this modpack, and some of its dependencies are no longer accessible from their original sources. To preserve the ability for players to enjoy SkyPlebbin, this backup version ensures:

- 100% Mod Inclusion: All mods are included directly in the overrides folder.
- Offline Availability: No dependencies are served via Modrinth or other online sources for this version.
- Long-Term Playability: Players can continue using the modpack even if Modrinth or other sources go offline.
- Key Features of Version 1.0.9
  - Complete Mod Integration: All mods and dependencies are bundled within the package.
  - Standalone Functionality: No internet reliance for downloading additional files.
  - Version Equivalency: Matches functionality of Modrinth-hosted Version 1.0.1.

## Disclaimer

This version uses fabric modloader 0.14.24 for Minecraft 1.20.1. All of the mods contained within this version are compatible with each other. Do not update them to new versions or it will guaranteed break the compatibility.

This is the final version of the SkyPlebbin modpack and will no longer receive updates or support. Use this backup to ensure uninterrupted play even in the absence of online dependencies.

By using this backup, you're ensuring the legacy of SkyPlebbin for yourself and others. Enjoy!
